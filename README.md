# digitalhouse-mobile

This folder contains the React Native (Android & iOS) app code.

Recommended (budget-friendly) setup:
- Use Expo for faster development.
- Create the app and keep all app code inside `mobile/src/`.

Example:
```bash
# from DigitalHouse/
npx create-expo-app mobile --template
```
